# Super simple react setup
This is for people who want just a quick react setup without any bells and whistles. Its definintely missing alot

## How to compile
When you first get the project don't forget to `npm install`

Then
`npm run build`
will compile your app jsx to on js file in dist/

### Some things that are missing with this setup
- All the magic from create-react-app
- Hot reloading
- A watch option in package.json to compile when your changes are made
- Polyfills
- My dad who left for a pack of smokes in 1993
